### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Currently, I work at a digital marketing firm where I build WordPress and WooCommerce websites in multiple languages. In addition to website development, I also provide SEO services. I utilize Google Tag Manager, Analytics, and Yandex.Metrica for metrics tracking. Furthermore, I am in the process of learning Google Ads for advertising purposes. I engage in meetings with potential clients for corporate relationship management.
